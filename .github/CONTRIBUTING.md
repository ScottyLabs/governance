# How to Contribute to Governance?

## Did you find a bug?

- **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Governance**, and instead send an email to [ops@scottylabs.org](mailto:ops@scottylabs.org).

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ScottyLabs/governance/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem,
  [open a new one](https://github.com/ScottyLabs/governance/issues/new).
  Be sure to include a **title and clear description** and as much relevant information as possible.

## Do you have an idea for a new feature?

- **Ensure the feature was not already proposed** by searching on GitHub under
  [Issues](https://github.com/ScottyLabs/Governance/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem,
  [open a new one](https://github.com/ScottyLabs/Governance/issues/new).
  Be sure to include a **title and description** of the feature you want to add.

## Do you want to contribute to the codebase?

### Find an Issue

Start by lookging through the [open issues](https://github.com/ScottyLabs/governance/issues)
to find something you are interested in working on. Please avoid picking issues
that are already assigned to someone.

- Look for issues labeled [**good first issue**](https://github.com/ScottyLabs/governance/labels/good%20first%20issue).
  These are great entry points for new contributors.

If you don’t see something that interests you, feel free to
[open a new issue](https://github.com/ScottyLabs/governance/issues/new) with your idea.

Note that a new contributor won't be assigned to the issue until their PR is merged.
This helps keep issues open for others who might also want to work on them, but
we will try to not assign the same issue to multiple contributors over a short
period of time.

### Request Permission

Follow the instructions in [Governance](https://github.com/ScottyLabs/governance)
to add yourself as a [contributor](https://github.com/ScottyLabs/governance/blob/main/docs/contributors.md)
and join the [Governance team](https://github.com/ScottyLabs/governance/blob/main/teams/governance.toml)
as an applicant to obtain the necessary permissions.

When opening your Governance PR, make sure to
[link the corresponding issue](<https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/>).

### Setup, Develop, and Submit a Pull Request

This process is really dependent on the issue you are working on, so please
communicate proactively with your reviewer(s) on any questions or concerns.

Once your PR is merged and that you have also come to one ScottyLabs work session
(more info in the [Communication wiki page](https://github.com/ScottyLabs/wiki/wiki/Communication)),
you will be included as a Governance developer in the
[Governance team](https://github.com/ScottyLabs/governance/blob/main/teams/governance.toml), **forever**!

## Do you have questions?

Ask any question in the [ScottyLabs Slack](https://github.com/ScottyLabs/wiki/wiki/Communication)
by DMing any [maintainer of Governance](https://github.com/ScottyLabs/governance/blob/main/teams/governance.toml)!
