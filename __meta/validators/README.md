# Validators

This directory contains the Rust-based validation tools for the governance repository.

## Validate Commit Message

We enforce [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Check EditorConfig Compliance

We use [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) to ensure consistent coding styles.
The VSCode extension [editorconfig.editorconfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=editorconfig.editorconfig)
will format files automatically when saving. You can also run the check locally by
installing [editorconfig-checker](https://github.com/editorconfig-checker/editorconfig-checker?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
and running `editorconfig-checker`.

## Validate TOML Files

We use [Taplo](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/) to validate the TOML files against
the schemas defined in the `__meta/schemas/` directory. The VSCode extension
[tamasfe.even-better-toml](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml)
will show red squiggles in the editor for errors. You can also run the check locally by
installing [taplo-cli](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/cli/introduction.html)
and running `taplo fmt --check` and `taplo check`.

## Validate Governance Rules

We also include several other checks to ensure integrity:

- The key orderings in a TOML file must match the the ordering of `properties` in the corresponding schema file.

- The `github-username` field for contributors must match the filename.

- The `slug` field for teams must match the filename.

- All maintainers in a team must also be listed as contributors.

- Cross-references must be valid (team contributors must exist in the `contributors/` directory).

- GitHub users and repositories must exist.

- Slack member IDs and channel IDs must be valid.

- Pull requests adding a new contributor must be submitted by the contributor themselves. This self-nomination approach promotes ownership, helps maintain the integrity of our contributor list, and encourages active participation with our governance process and the organization. PRs in violation will be automatically rejected.

- When adding a new team, the team members must have already been added in previous PRs due to the earlier requirement on adding contributors. For similar reasons, you must be a maintainer of any team you create.

## Validate CODEOWNERS

We use the [mszostok/codeowners-validator](https://github.com/mszostok/codeowners-validator)
tool to validate the autogenerated `CODEOWNERS` file. This check fails on PRs
from forks, so it is not run for them.

## Development

Validation runs automatically through GitHub Actions on PRs and pushes to main,
so the following instructions will not be relevant to most people.
If you are interested, you can also test validators locally, but some checks
will produce warnings due to the lack of environment variables.

1. Make sure you are in the root of the repository.

2. Install Rust with `rustup`, if you do not already have it installed:

    ```sh
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

3. Install `cargo-binstall` (enables use of `cargo binstall`):

    ```sh
    cargo install cargo-binstall
    ```

4. Install Taplo:

    ```sh
    cargo binstall taplo-cli
    ```

5. Check TOML files for proper formatting and/or against the schemas:

    ```sh
    taplo fmt --check # for formatting
    taplo check # against the schemas
    ```

6. Run the other checks specified above:

    ```sh
    cargo run --bin governance
    ```
