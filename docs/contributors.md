# Joining as a contributor

> [!NOTE]
> This is for individuals seeking to register themselves as a contributor under governance.

Create a new TOML file in `contributors/` with your GitHub username as the filename,
e.g. `your-github-username.toml`:

```toml
full-name = "Your Name"
github-username = "your-github-username"
slack-member-id = "U9999999999"
andrew-id = "your-andrew-id"
```

Visit the [contributor schema](../__meta/schemas/contributor.schema.json)
to learn more about the fields.

To find your `slack-member-id`, see
[Slack Wiki page](https://github.com/ScottyLabs/governance/wiki/Slack).
