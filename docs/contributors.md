# Joining as a contributor

> [!NOTE]
> This is for individuals seeking to register themselves as a contributor under governance.

Create a new TOML file in `contributors/` with your GitHub username as the filename, e.g. `your-github-username.toml`:

```toml
full-name = "Your Name"
github-username = "your-github-username"
slack-member-id = "U07FPJKFB5E"
andrew-id = "your-andrew-id"
```

Visit the [contributor schema](../__meta/schemas/contributor.schema.json) to learn more about the fields.

To find your `slack-member-id`, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your profile
2. Click the three dots
3. Select "Copy member ID"

This value should begin with a `U`.
